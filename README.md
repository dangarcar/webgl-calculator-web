# WebGL Calculator (web version)

This is a only vanilla TS (with Vite) version of [WebGL calculator (tauri version)](https://github.com/dangarcar/webgl-calculator-tauri)

It's deployed in Github Pages: [here](https://github.com/dangarcar/webgl-calculator-web)

The functions of the program are almost the same as the Tauri version, but this it's a little bit simpler, as it doesn't have two rendering modes, it only has compiled mode.
